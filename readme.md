## Description
ChatGPT has fundamentally transformed the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Powered by OpenAI's GPT3.5 and GPT4 Large Language Models (LLMs), ChatGPT offers human-level intelligence across a myriad of tasks. These neural networks, equipped with billions of parameters, have been trained on extensive datasets sourced from the internet and beyond, enabling them through an interactive, conversational interface. This has opened up new avenues in Prompt Engineering—the science and art of leveraging frameworks like LangChain to create sophisticated conversational agents.

Prompt Engineering combines document processing, language modeling, and text encoding to enhance the semantic understanding of LLMs. It also utilizes vector databases and search engines to equip agents with memory, alongside prompt formatting modules to contextualize interactions.

As AI technologies like ChatGPT continue to disrupt industries, their potential applications—such as in customer service—are becoming increasingly apparent. These advanced systems not only offer significant cost reductions but are also setting the stage for widespread changes across various job functions and industries.

This course is designed to empower technical teams with the knowledge to innovate and integrate these groundbreaking technologies into their operations, ensuring your organization remains at the forefront of the AI revolution.

## What You Will Learn
Participants in this course will gain hands-on experience in building conversational agents using cutting-edge technologies. Key areas of focus include:

- **Large Language Models:** Understanding the fundamentals that power LLMs.
- **LangChain Framework:** Using LangChain to build Generative AI applications.
- **LLM APIs and Local Open-source LLMs:** Interacting with APIs from OpenAI and managing LLMs locally to ensure privacy and customization.
- **Memory, Agents, Chain and Prompt Enhancement for Chatbots:** Using various tools to customize the chatbot

Participants will conclude the course with their own Chatbot project, equipped with practical, deployable code. This project will not only address real-world challenges but also lay the groundwork for further development within their respective business domains.

## Course Impact
Upon completing this course, participants will be able to:

- Build custom Chatbots using the LangChain framework.
- Understand and apply the principles of modern LLMs and Prompt Engineering.
- Interact effectively with both remote and local LLM APIs.
- Employ LLMs for various machine learning tasks beyond Chatbot development.

This course is an essential step for anyone looking to integrate AI into their business processes, offering a proactive approach to navigating the evolving landscape of AI technologies.
